# ExperienceEditorToggle
Sitecore module to make the experience editor's ribbon be toggle-able

This module patches into sitecore's pipeline code that renders the Experience Editor ribbon and makes it toggleable.  This becomes especially useful when using a fixed header or just generally for getting more in context editing real estate.
